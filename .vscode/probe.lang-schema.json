Unfortunately, datapack reloads often take upwards of 30 seconds and so this very severely affects world loading times.\n\nModernFix makes the necessary changes to avoid this reload, based on the unfinished Forge PR #8163.\n\nThis change was removed by Forge in 1.18, but then a similar patch was added *again* in 1.19 to fix mod datapacks not being loaded when creating new singleplayer worlds. Fortunately, the issue is localized to the world creation screen in 1.19, and existing worlds only require a single reload. However, this still doubles the length of the lag spike when clicking \"Create New World\" in 1.19, and so ModernFix again makes changes to not perform a redundant reload.","type":"string"},"solarcraft.command.description.fragment_dump":{"description":"Dumps the list of Registered solarcraft Fragments","type":"string"},"death.attack.dragon.0":{"description":"%s was split in two by a dragon","type":"string"},"death.attack.dragon.2":{"description":"%s was devoured by a dragon","type":"string"},"death.attack.dragon.1":{"description":"%s was torn to shreds by a dragon","type":"string"},"create.ponder.mechanical_piston.header":{"description":"Moving Structures using Mechanical Pistons","type":"string"},"item.minecraft.tipped_arrow.effect.awkward":{"description":"Tipped Arrow","type":"string"},"mco.client.incompatible.title":{"description":"Client incompatible!","type":"string"},"block.minecraft.banner.stripe_center.orange":{"description":"Orange Pale","type":"string"},"bountiful.decree.leatherer.name":{"description":"Leatherworking","type":"string"},"block.create.black_sail":{"description":"Black Sail","type":"string"},"item.botania.rune_winter":{"description":"Rune of Winter","type":"string"},"quark.jei.hint.music_disc_endermosh":{"description":"Can be found in End City chests.","type":"string"},"block.aetherworks.suevite_small_tile_wall":{"description":"Suevite Small Tile Wall","type":"string"},"iris.sodium.failure.reason.incompatible":{"description":"Oculus requires Rubidium for good performance, but an incompatible version was found.

After all i am scientist, not a fighter! The creatures near the crystal were torn to shreds while the ones who managed to run away were barely touched. As i glanced from a safe distance, i also noticed that it strikes the ground and it starts raining some electric projectiles there, maybe the crystal uses this attack to disable its enemies.

Examples include right before reaching the main menu (during the \"Freezing data\" stage), as well as multiple (!) times when a world is being loaded.\n\nModernFix solves this performance bottleneck by instead making cache rebuilds lazy. Each blockstate rebuilds its cache the first time the data would be accessed. At any point when vanilla or Forge would attempt to rebuild caches for all blockstates, this is redirected to simply invalidate the cache on each blockstate instead.\n\nThis should not have any impact on TPS after startup concludes.","type":"string"},"block.quark.oxidized_cut_copper_vertical_slab":{"description":"Oxidized Cut Copper Vertical Slab","type":"string"},"ars_nouveau.item_detector.inverted":{"description":"Signal Inverted: %s","type":"string"},"block.ars_nouveau.smooth_gilded_sourcestone_small_bricks_slab":{"description":"Smooth Gilded Sourcestone: Small Bricks Slab","type":"string"},"item.kitchenkarrot.pickled_sea_pickles":{"description":"Pickled Sea Pickles","type":"string"},"block.create.small_asurine_brick_stairs":{"description":"Small Asurine Brick Stairs","type":"string"},"create.recipe.fan_haunting":{"description":"Bulk Haunting","type":"string"},"effect.supplementaries.overencumbered.description":{"description":"Prevents sprinting.

The cache is rebuilt on resource reload (except for the vanilla resources, since they should never change while the game is running).\n\nThere are no known compatibility issues with this patch except for OptiFine (its CTM resources do not load correctly).
